	<P class="cnnBodyText"><br>     ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  It is 5:00 a.m. in Libya right now, day 15 in the battle for the future of that country, a battle that will have ripple effects on us all.
     Moammar Gadhafi faced reporters today and spun a story of what he says is happening in Libya.  It was a story.  He says the people love him.  His son says everything is peaceful.  Tonight you will hear their statements and then you will hear the facts of what is happening.  You will hear facts and you will see evidence for yourselves.  You will learn the truth from our reporters on the ground and the Libyan people themselves trapped in their homes in many cases, but speaking out, no longer letting fear rule their lives, new video tonight of fighting taking place about 130 miles to the east of Tripoli in a city called Misurata where anti-government protesters are in control.  
     Listen to the fire.  You can see some of the tracer fire, heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft guns.  When aimed at human beings, it is devastating.  Also, 30 miles west of Tripoli, this is the scene, the city of Zawiyah also controlled by anti-government protesters tonight. 
     But Gadhafi's grip on Tripoli, the capital, remains tight, though his grip on reality does not.  Take a look at his newest interview, talking about how his people love him.  
     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
     M. GADHAFI:  They love me.  All my people with me, they love me, all.   
     CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, HOST, "THIS WEEK WITH CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR": But if they do love...
     (CROSSTALK)
     M. GADHAFI:  They will die to protect me, my people.  
     (CROSSTALK) 
     AMANPOUR:  If you say they do love you, then why are they capturing Benghazi and they say they're against you there?  Why are they...
     M. GADHAFI:  It is al Qaeda.  It is al Qaeda.  It is al Qaeda, not my people.  It is al Qaeda.  
     AMANPOUR:  Al Qaeda? 
     M. GADHAFI:  Al Qaeda, al Qaeda, yes.  They came from outside.
     (END VIDEO CLIP) 
     COOPER:  Saying Qaeda, saying it's al Qaeda, Moammar Gadhafi blaming al Qaeda yet again.  We're going to talk to one reporter who interviewed Gadhafi in a moment.
     America's U.N. ambassador today calling his statements delusional.  Whatever you call them, you can add his latest comments to a long list of lies he's been telling for days.  Listen.  
     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
     M. GADHAFI (through translator):  RPG, rocket launchers has been provided to Benghazi by the Americans.  They offer them those hallucination pills in order to use them.  Those youth, 16-, 17-year- old, are not guilty because they are manipulated by people from Tunisia.  
     These coming from Misurata, they spike their coffees or milk with (END each. After they take these tablets, go and attack this police station.  
     (END VIDEO CLIP) 
     COOPER:  Well, Gadhafi's son Saif who for years has paraded around the west and the United States in silk suits talking about reforms and trying to attract investors to Libya, well, he now appears as fake as his father.  Listen to what he told Christian Amanpour.  
     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
     SAIF AL-ISLAM GADHAFI, SON OF MOAMMAR GADHAFI:  Everything is calm.  Everything is people.  The point is, there's a big, big gap between reality and the media reports.  
     CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, HOST, "THIS WEEK WITH CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR": Saif, I'm going to ask you a question.
     S. GADHAFI:  Yes.  
     AMANPOUR:  You say there is a big, big gap between reality and media reports.  Some might say there is a big, big gap between what you're thinking and saying to me and the reality around the rest of Libya.  
     GADHAFI:  Why the south -- the whole south is calm.  The west is calm.  The middle is calm, even part of the east.  
     (END VIDEO CLIP) 
     COOPER:  Some might say.  Well, that is a fact.  
     Everything is peaceful, he claims, and it is a fact it is not. He denies killing Libyans.  Let's just repeat that.  The Gadhafi -- the regime are claiming everything is peaceful and they have not slaughtered civilians in the streets.  
     I want to show you the reality, new video from a hospital in Misurata.  It's disturbing video.  And I do want to warn you that. But when a ruler claims that their hands are clean, the only way to show you they are not is to show you how just blood-soaked those hands really are.  We don't know the stories of these two men who are clearly dead in a hospital in Misurata. 
     But we talked to a doctor in a hospital there who has seen many dead and many wounded for days.  
     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's lying.  He and his son, they're lying. They're killing -- they're looking of people every day.  That's what they're doing now just to protect their selves and their regime.  
     (END VIDEO CLIP) 
     COOPER:  Well, the Gadhafis deny it, but U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon estimates 1,000 people have been killed in Libya so far.  
     Libya's former America's ambassador today said the number may be closer to 2,000.  We frankly don't know.  We showed you Gadhafi's son Saif with a smile and a wink on his face on Friday before an interview with CNN Turk.  When he gives interviews to Western reporters, he tries to seem reasonable.  
     But take a look at him in Tripoli in Arabic brandishing a weapon promising to his supporters to get them more weapons.  
     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
     S. GADHAFI (through translator):  Don't leave your country for vagrants.  These people are not an army or anything.  They are just trash, vagrants.  
     Today, we will go out in Tripoli, my brothers.  You will live in it, and they won't be able to say anything.  I'm going now.  I will be sending you the weaponry, and tonight I'm out to get more of it.  
     (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) 
     (END VIDEO CLIP) 
     COOPER:  The son promising more weaponry to fight an uprising his father denies is even happening.  
     Again, the best rebuttal to spin coming from the Libyan people, all of whom are taking a great risk to talk to us.  
     Earlier tonight, I spoke with a woman in Misurata.
     (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)      COOPER:  What is the situation right now in your town?  
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Currently, the city of Misurata is in the hands of the opposition.  There have been some skirmishes on the outskirts of the city.  
     I live in an area called Hadad (ph).  And there have been attacks on the radio antenna that's about a mile from my home for the past three days.  
     COOPER:  Attacks by government forces?  
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  
     COOPER:  And you have heard that?  
     (CROSSTALK) 
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, I did.  
     One of the reasons that they're -- well, the reason that they're trying to attack the antenna, that the opposition forces are using the radio station to organize the city.  So that's the reason that there have been so many attacks.  
     COOPER:  Are you scared?  
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sometimes.  Sometimes I am, honestly. Other times, I'm not.  It just depends I guess on how much shooting is going on, or what kind of reports are coming through the media outlets at any given time.  
     COOPER:  Do you think that -- that Tripoli will continue to remain in Gadhafi hands?  
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, I don't.  
     You know, this regime has been here for 42 years, and it's reached its end.  I'm confident that the regime will fall soon, if not today, then tomorrow, if not tomorrow, then within the next week or two or three, but his time has come to an end.  He's oppressed the Libyan people for over four decades.  We're not -- prior to the protests, people were afraid to speak on the phone.  
     They couldn't talk in the street.  People spoke in hushed tones. My father's a member of the opposition.  And so I was born and raised in California, but we had family members who were too afraid to call us, to keep in touch.  Or, even when my father came here, they were people who were too afraid to speak to him.  
     So people have been afraid and have been living under his tyrannical regime for too long.  We have reached the point of no return.  Too much blood has been shed and too many people have been injured for this regime to stay in place.  
     COOPER:  And yet you hear Gadhafi speak, you hear his son speak, and they essentially say they haven't been killing civilians, that there aren't even protests in Tripoli itself.  
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To say that is ridiculous.  I don't think that at this point anyone believes those kinds of things.  Gadhafi has been making all kinds of claims. 
     He says -- at one moment, he's saying that all of the Libyan people are taking hallucinogens.  Another moment, he's saying that we're all members of al Qaeda and that we're extremist Muslims.  He's just -- he's making -- he's all lover the place.  He's making all different kinds of nonsensical claims.  
     COOPER:  And his son Saif, who many in the West always considered the most reform-minded, the most sort of Western-oriented, walked around in nice slick suits, he seems to be saying these exact same things that his father is now saying.  
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's as barbaric as his father.  When he spoke on -- to the first address to the nation, we thought that he was going to come talking of reforms, the same way that we heard leaders in Egypt and in Tunisia.  
     And he came saying that Libya was going to turn into another Algeria, and that women were going to be raped and that people -- whole cities were going to be massacred, and all sorts of these veiled threats.  He's like his father, if not worse.  
     COOPER:  And when you hear them say they will arm citizens, they will open up the arsenals, does that scare you?  Does that worry you?  
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't -- I don't believe that.  You know, he's too afraid that the people would use those against him.  I don't believe those claims.  He's too afraid.  
     COOPER:  So what do you want people to know about what is happening right now?
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That Libyans are not members of al Qaeda. That's absolutely ridiculous.  
     And we're not all -- not -- everyone's not on drugs here, that we're fighting for our basic rights, the right to freedom, the right to education, the right to health care, the right to clean water, the right to just basic human rights, and that we will continue to fight until this regime falls.  
     COOPER:  Take care.  Thank you for talking to us.  
     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you.  
     (END VIDEOTAPE)
     COOPER:  Yet again another woman risking her life to tell us what's happening from her vantage point in Libya.  
     We have extensive coverage tonight. Fouad Ajami is with us, also Nic Robertson in Tripoli and many others.  You can join the live chat at AC360.com.
     Up next, we will talk to one of the reporters who sat down today to Gadhafi.  I'm curious to hear if she -- if she thinks Gadhafi really believes this stuff he's saying.  
     And later, the U.S. responds to the possibility of a no-fly zone. I will talk with a former CIA officer about what groups might come to power after Gadhafi.
     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
     NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The signs are saying and the crowd here are saying things like, Gadhafi, you bloodsucker; Gadhafi, you and your family have to go.  
     They're also calling, we want guns, we want guns.  
     (END VIDEO CLIP) 
     (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
     COOPER:  Some new video tonight just translated from a Libyan hospital, the voice on it saying these are the weapons that they used against the people of Misurata, anti-aircraft and anti-tank.  This is coming from a man who seems to be a doctor.  They are -- he says these are all the kind of weapons to kill the youth of Misurata.
     Meantime, American warships are moving closer to Libya, the U.S. and NATO weighing a no fly zone over the country.  We will talk about that in a little bit.  The global community is distancing itself obviously from the Gadhafi regime.  And Gadhafi himself is doubling down on the denial card.
     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
     M. GADHAFI:  They love me.  All my people with me, they love me, all.   
     CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, HOST, "THIS WEEK WITH CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR": But if they do love...
     (CROSSTALK)
     M. GADHAFI:  They will die to protect me, my people.  
     (CROSSTALK) 
     AMANPOUR:  If you say they do love you, then why are they capturing Benghazi and they say they're against you there?  Why are they...
